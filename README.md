### Please Note
I put my inputs in a separate private repository. The scripts expect the input files to be in `inputs/D<NUMBER>/`.
If you want to run your own inputs against my code, then you'll have to set this up yourself.

So for Day 01, the script would expect the input file to be in
```
inputs/D01/input
```

## Day 01
For [day one](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1), run the go app via

```bash
cd D01
go run .
```

## Day 02
For [day two](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2), run the go app via

```bash
cd D02
go run .
```

## Day 03
For [day three](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3), run the bash script via

```bash
cd D03

./calc.sh

## Day 04
For [day four](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4), run the go app via

```bash
